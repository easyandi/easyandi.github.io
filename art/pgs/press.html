The result of this technology was twofold: it led to the creation of spurious banknotes that appeared authoritative and it encouraged the extensibility of an abstract vocabulary of monetary design.
              <br>
              Someone who understood and wrote about both these processes was a printer named Waterman Lily Ormsby who published a book in 1852 illustrating how the transfer press could produce monetary design by a process of collage. In that book Ormsby reproduced a diagram of his own transfer press and <em>Reassembly (Transfer Press)</em> is a series of schematic re-fabrications of Ormsby's press, scanned from his own illustrations. The variations are made on the basis of aesthetic fancy, rather than any technical rationale.
